# Phoenix-Stock-Mod
Mod for KSP that includes a modded version of the KR-2L engine and a craft file for the Phoenix.

Installation

	Inside of the “GameData” Folder should be a folder called “notjhnope”. To install, simply drag that folder into KSP’s GameData folder. Then, in order to use the Phoenix craft, open your save file’s folder, go to “Ships”, then “VAB” and drag the included “Phoenix.craft” file into that folder.

Use
	The Phoenix is able to take off vertically from KSC’s launchpad and easily enter an orbit around Kerbin at any height. From there, you have the choice of going to any planet in the system, as the Phoenix’s Cochrane PH1 engine more than enough thrust to perform maneuvers with ease. Surprisingly, the Phoenix is able to land on most planets with the help of it’s landing gear, located on the bottom of the ship. The PH1 engine has an incredibly high heat tolerance, meaning that in most situations, provided you slow your descent with more throttle input, it should be safe to reenter and land with the engine pointed retrograde. Upon nearing the surface, the Phoenix should be rotated forward so that she is able to land safely on her gear.
	In terms of power generation, the Phoenix has a more than ample supply of electricity. In emergencies, she carriers several small reactors onboard for power generation, as well as an extendable solar panel (press 1 on the keyboard to toggle). Her PH1 engine is also extremely efficient, meaning that you shouldn’t run out of fuel very soon.
	On the Phoenix’s nose is a shrouded docking port, which can be exposed in order to rendezvous with a refuel craft or station (Proceed with caution, however, as the Phoenix does not respond to RCS very well), and on each of her nacelles is an addition docking port.
